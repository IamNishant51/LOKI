## Reporting a Vulnerability

**LOKI** runs with high privileges on the user's local machine (access to file system, shell, etc.). We take security seriously.

If you discover a vulnerability, please DO NOT open a public issue.

### Critical Vectors
We are specifically interested in:
- **Sandbox Escapes**: If the agent can modify files outside the allowed working directory (if restricted).
- **Prompt Injection**: If external text (e.g., from a website read by the agent) can hijack the agent's instructions to execute malicious commands.
- **Data Exfiltration**: If the agent can be tricked into sending local data to an external server.

### Reporting Process
1. Email details to: `security@nishantunavane.com` (or your email).
2. Include reproduction steps.
3. We will acknowledge within 48 hours.

## Disclaimer
LOKI executes code generated by an LLM. While we implement safeguards, **always review code/commands before execution**. The user assumes all responsibility for actions taken by the agent.
