# Monetization Strategy

LOKI is designed to be sustainable without exploiting user data.

## The Promise
1. **Free Core**: The local engine (Ollama, local RAG, Tools) will always be free (MIT).
2. **No Data Selling**: We will never sell, analyze, or upload user code/chats.
3. **No Lock-in**: You can swap models, providers, and tools at any time.

## Future Business Model (Opt-In)
- **Cloud Acceleration**: Users can pay for a high-speed inference endpoint (e.g. hosted Llama 3 70B) if local hardware is slow.
- **Team Sync**: Encrypted, peer-to-peer memory synchronization for teams requires a relay server (subscription).
- **Enterprise**: Audit logs, SSO enforcement, and custom tool registries.

This model aligns our incentives with yours: we only make money if we provide *added value* on top of a solid free core.
