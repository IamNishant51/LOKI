# Operational Ethics

LOKI allows for monetization, but strict rules apply.

## 1. User Data
- User data is NEVER sold.
- Conversation history is local-only by default.
- "Cloud" features must be explicitly enabled (Opt-In).

## 2. Models
- Default models must be open-weights (e.g. Mistral, Llama).
- Users must have the right to swap providers.

## 3. Transparency
- LOKI must always disclose if a tool is being used.
- LOKI must always disclose if data is leaving the machine (e.g. Groq usage).
