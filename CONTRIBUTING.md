# Contributing to LOKI

We welcome contributions! LOKI is built on typescript and node.js.

## Principles

1. **Local-First**: Features should work offline.
2. **Simple Architecture**: Avoid over-engineering.
3. **Explicit Behavior**: No magic. Tools should be transparent.

## Development

1. Fork the repo.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to test your changes.
4. Submit a PR.

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript.
- Follow the existing folder structure.
- Add comments for complex logic.
